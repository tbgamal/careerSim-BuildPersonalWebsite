# CEREER SIMULATION: PERSONAL WEBSITE

<!-- 

Notes to the rubric

  1. Minimum of 3 html files, 1 css (can be more than one i guess) and 1 js
  2. README a little description to the project like what language that we use etc, mentioning ourselves as the author. You can Google what to write on README!
  3. Are there any errors in the syntax? As long as the page isn't crashing!
  4. Persistent header links means the header isn't going away when we move to another page.
  5. use classes and id's are encouraged
  6. JavaScript: only wanted to see if js files can be connected. Just do console.log or Alert would be fine

 This repository contains various linked html, css and js files as part of **Fullstack Academy Career Simulation** for its web development program.

 In this repository you will be able to find my personal CV in HTML form with some basic *(hopefully improving)* CSS formating and a basic Hello World level JavaScript file.

 Here is a guide or description to the files contained in the repository:
 1. index.html      - landing page of the HTML
 2. about.html      - About me page *(for now)* containing my education background
 3. portfolio.html  - My Experience page containing my professional experience and personal projects
 4. css-reset.css   - A CSS reset template gained through third party website
 5. style.css       - My basic level CSS formatting linked to all the above three HTML files
 6. javascript.js   - A basic Hello World JavaScript file
 7. images folder   - Contains image assets used in the HTML files

 ***Notes to the instructors:*** *Please let me know if you have feedbacks to improve my very first website as I know there are still a whole lot of room to improve.*

 Thank you!
