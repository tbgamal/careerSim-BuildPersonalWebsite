Notes to the rubric

  1. Minimum of 3 html files, 1 css (can be more than one i guess) and 1 js
  2. README a little description to the project like what language that we use etc, mentioning ourselves as the author. You can Google what to write on README!
  3. Are there any errors in the syntax? As long as the page isn't crashing!
  4. Persistent header links means the header isn't going away when we move to another page.
  5. use classes and id's are encouraged
  6. JavaScript: only wanted to see if js files can be connected. Just do console.log or Alert would be fine
