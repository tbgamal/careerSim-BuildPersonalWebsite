# CEREER SIMULATION: PERSONAL WEBSITE

 This repository contains various linked html, css and js files as part of **Fullstack Academy Career Simulation** for its web development program.

 In this repository you will be able to find my personal CV in HTML form with some basic *(hopefully improving)* CSS formating and a basic Hello World level JavaScript file.

 Here is a guide or description to the files contained in the repository:
 1. index.html      - landing page of the HTML
 2. about.html      - About me page *(for now)* containing my education background
 3. portfolio.html  - My Experience page containing my professional experience and personal projects
 4. css-reset.css   - A CSS reset template gained through third party website
 5. style.css       - My basic level CSS formatting linked to all the above three HTML files
 6. javascript.js   - A basic Hello World JavaScript file
 7. images folder   - Contains image assets used in the HTML files

 ***Notes to the instructors:*** *Please let me know if you have feedbacks to improve my very first website as I know there are still a whole lot of room to improve.*

 Thank you!
